# Lab 4: Container Packaging

This lab is originally taken from Docker community training for beginner. In this lab, we will look at some basic Docker commands and a simple build-ship-run workflow. We’ll start by running some simple containers, then we’ll use a Dockerfile to build a custom app. Finally, we’ll look at how to use bind mounts to modify a running container as you might if you were actively developing using Docker.



## Prerequisites

* Create DockerID from https://hub.docker.com
